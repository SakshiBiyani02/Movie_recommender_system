# Movie Recommender System
# Overview
This project implements a movie recommendation system using cosine similarity to suggest movies based on user preferences. The system analyzes movie features and user ratings to provide tailored recommendations.

# Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook
# Dataset
The dataset consists of movie titles, genres, ratings, and other relevant features. The data is preprocessed to create a feature matrix suitable for similarity calculations.
# How It Works
Data Preprocessing: Load and clean the dataset. Extract features relevant for recommendations.
Feature Vectorization: Convert movie features into a numerical format (e.g., using TF-IDF for genres).
Cosine Similarity Calculation: Compute the cosine similarity between movie feature vectors.
Recommendation Generation: For a given movie, find and display the most similar movies based on similarity scores.
# Getting Started
Clone the repository or download the Jupyter Notebook.
Ensure you have the required libraries installed (use pip install -r requirements.txt).
Run the notebook and follow the instructions to input a movie and receive recommendations.
# Example Usage
Input a movie title, and the system will return a list of recommended movies based on similarity.
